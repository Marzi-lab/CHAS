## Cell type-specific Histone Acetylation Score (CHAS)
### Cell type deconvolution of bulk tissue H3K27ac profiles

*CHAS* is an R-package for inferring cell type-specific signatures in bulk brain H3K27ac profiles. *CHAS* annotates peaks identified in bulk brain studies of H3K27ac to cell type-specific signals in four major brain cell types, and based on signal intensities generates cell type-specific histone acetylation scores to act as a proxy for cell type proportion.

Background
------
Cell type identity is a major driver of epigenetic variation, making biological interpretation of bulk tissue epigenomes difficult. Here we present *CHAS* (cell type-specific histone acetylation score), an R package for inferring cell type-specific signatures in bulk brain H3K27ac profiles. *CHAS* annotates peaks identified in bulk brain studies of H3K27ac to cell type-specific signals in four major brain cell types, and based on signal intensities generates cell type-specific histone acetylation scores to act as a proxy for cell type proportion. *CHAS* was successfully validated in pseudo-bulk samples of known cell type proportions and applied to three neurodegenerative disorder epigenome-wide association studies conducted on bulk brain tissue. *CHAS* adds to the existing frameworks for cell type deconvolution in bulk brain tissue and we would expect to be able to extend the use of *CHAS* to other bulk tissue H3K27ac profiles.

### 1. Identification of cell type-specific peaks in bulk tissue H3K27ac profiles.

*CHAS* annotates peaks identified in bulk tissue studies of H3K27ac to their cell type-specific signals by overlapping the bulk peaks with cell sorted H3K27ac peaks and identifying which of the bulk peaks are specific to a given cell type. For a bulk peak to be defined as cell type-specific two criteria must be met: (i) the bulk peak is annotated only to a single cell type; (ii) the bulk peak overlaps a predefined percentage of that cell typeâ€™s peak.

### 2. Cell type-specific histone acetylation score generation.

Using a counts per million matrix and the cell type-specific bulk H3K27ac peaks identified in step 1 of the workflow, *CHAS* generates scores by averaging the normalised signal intensity of a sample across all peaks specific to a given cell type, thereby deriving a proxy of the proportion of that cell type in the given bulk sample. As a constraint from peak-normalisation, the maximum signal intensity for any given peak and sample is 1 and the resulting score will lie between 0 and 1 for a given sample and cell type.
