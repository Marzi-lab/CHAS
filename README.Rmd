## Introduction 

Cell type identity is a major driver of epigenetic variation, making biological interpretation of bulk tissue epigenomes difficult. Here we present CHAS (cell type-specific histone acetylation score), an R package for inferring cell type-specific signatures in bulk brain H3K27ac profiles. CHAS annotates peaks identified in bulk brain studies of H3K27ac to cell type-specific signals in four major brain cell types, and based on signal intensities generates cell type-specific histone acetylation scores to act as a proxy for cell type proportion. CHAS was successfully validated in pseudo-bulk samples of known cell type proportions and applied to three brain disorder epigenome-wide association studies conducted on bulk brain tissue.

## CHAS workflow 

![alt text](https://github.com/KittyMurphy/CHAS/blob/master/CHAS_workflow.png)

### 1. Identification of cell type-specific peaks in bulk brain H3K27ac profiles.

CHAS annotates peaks identified in bulk tissue studies of H3K27ac to their cell type-specific signals by overlapping the bulk peaks with cell sorted H3K27ac peaks and identifying which of the bulk peaks are specific to a given cell type. For a bulk peak to be defined as cell type-specific two criteria must be met: (i) the bulk peak is annotated only to a single cell type; (ii) the bulk peak overlaps a predefined percentage of that cell type’s peak.

### 2. Cell type-specific histone acetylation score generation.

Using a counts per million matrix and the cell type-specific bulk H3K27ac peaks identified in step 1 of the workflow, CHAS generates scores by averaging the normalised signal intensity of a sample across all peaks specific to a given cell type, thereby deriving a proxy of the proportion of that cell type in the given bulk sample. As a constraint from peak-normalisation, the maximum signal intensity for any given peak and sample is 1 and the resulting score will lie between 0 and 1 for a given sample and cell type.
