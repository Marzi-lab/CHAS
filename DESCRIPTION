Package: CHAS
Title: Cell type-specific Histone Acetylation Score
Version: 0.99.8
Description: CHAS is an R package which integrates cell sorted H3K27ac data
  to identify cell type-specific peaks in bulk tissue H3K27ac profiles. 
  Using the cell type-specific H3K27ac peaks, one can then calculate cell 
  type-specific acetylation scores to act as a proxy for cell type proportion 
  in the bulk tissue sample.
