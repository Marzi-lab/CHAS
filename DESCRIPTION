Package: CHAS
Title: Cell type deconvolution of bulk tissue histone acetylomes from epigenetic data
Version: 0.99.8
Description: CHAS is an R package which integrates cell sorted H3K27ac data to identify cell type-specific peaks in bulk tissue H3K27ac profiles. Using the cell type-specific H3K27ac peaks, one can then calculate cell type-specific acetylation scores to act as a proxy for cell type proportion in the bulk tissue sample.
